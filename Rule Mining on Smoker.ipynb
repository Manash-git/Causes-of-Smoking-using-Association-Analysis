    "**What is apriori algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori Algorithm is a Machine Learning algorithm that is used to gain insight into the structured relationships between different items involved. It’s a data mining technique that is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Recommending products based on your purchased items. You can see this in different e-commerce websites. (Recommendation system)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things that we need to know before implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Association rule:** \n",
    "It identifies frequent patterns and associations(relations) among a set of items. Ex: If you go to buy a keyboard, you might also get a mouse. So place them aside in your market to get more profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support:** \n",
    "Support refers to the default popularity of an item and can be calculated by finding the number of transactions containing a particular item divided by total number of transactions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Support (Keyboard) = (Transactions containing (Keyboard)) / (Total Transactions))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Confidence:**\n",
    "Confidence refers to the likelihood that an item B (mouse) is also bought if item A (keyboard) is bought. Like our keyboard and mouse example. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Confidence(Keyboard→Mouse) = (Transactions containing both (Keyboard and Mouse))/(Transactions containing Keyboard)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lift:**\n",
    "Lift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of Mouse when the Keyboard is sold. \n",
    "Lift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(Keyboard→Mouse) divided by Support(Mouse). \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) = (Confidence(Keyboard→Mouse))   /  (Support (Mouse))\n",
